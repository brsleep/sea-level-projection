Sea Level Projections for Charleston, SC (NOAA)

10/26/21: Repository created
-------------------------------------------------------------
     This is as much exploration of data visualization for me as it is a class project.
I am working on duplicating regionalized sea level projections made by NOAA as they are not available directly. I am figuring out how to display this data in an effective way.

Current Toolkit: pandas, matplotlib, python...
