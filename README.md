     This is a class project for Design Thinking with Dr. Brygg Ullmer, and a personal exploration of data visualization.
I am working on duplicating regionalized sea level projections made by NOAA as they are not available directly. I am figuring out how to display this data in an effective way.

Current Toolkit: pandas, matplotlib, python...
